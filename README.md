# FloatGuard: Efficient Whole-Program Detection of Floating-Point Exceptions in AMD GPUs

## Overview

FloatGuard is a tool that captures floating-point exceptions in your AMD HIP
kernels. It is as of now the first publicly available tool that detects and
captures runtime floating-point exceptions in AMD HIP programs running on AMD
GPUs. FloatGuard leverages AMD GPU hardware registers to detect floating-point
exceptions, overcoming the limitations of AMD’s built-in trapping mechanisms
through a novel algorithm that combines assembly- and source-level
instrumentation with debugger-guided execution. 

The details of the tool and how it evaluates can be found in [[1]](#1).
The workflow of FloatGuard is shown below:

FloatGuard consists of two modules implemented in Python: (1) a compiler wrapper
which processes HIP program source files, compiles them into assembly, and
injects code during link time that enables floating-point exception capture—it
also accepts a list of already-captured floating-point exception code locations
to prevent them from being triggered in subsequent iterations; and (2) a testing
framework, which runs the instrumented HIP program with a custom ROCgdb debugger
that detects and records floating- point exceptions as they occur. Both modules
are run iteratively until all floating-point exceptions have been reported.

## Download and Run FloatGuard

### Prerequisites

1. Linux system. We have tested on Ubuntu 22.04 and TOSS 4.
2. Python (>= 3.9) installed.
3. AMD GPU with ROCm installed. Tested on ROCm 6.1.2 with AMD Clang 17.0.0.
Follow https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/ for more
information on how to install AMD ROCm. Specifically, make sure both `rocm` and 
`rocm-llvm-dev` packages are installed.

### Download FloatGuard

Clone this GitHub repository with the following command.

```
git clone https://github.com/LLNL/FloatGuard [FloatGuard Directory]
```

### Running Samples for make and CMake projects

We provide two sample projects, `samples/div0` and `samples/div0_cmake`, for developers
to try out and learn what is required for your own HIP code to work with FloatGuard.
You can refer to `samples/div0/Makefile` and `samples/div0_cmake/CMakeLists.txt` for examples
of the steps described in previous sections. To run these samples, simply enter the respective
directories and run the following command:

```
[FloatGuard Directory]/gdb_script/time_measure.py
```

Log files containing details on the floating-point exceptions found are
outputted as `[code project directory name]_output.txt` file in the FloatGuard code repo directory.
Also `result.csv` updates the running time statistics and the number of
exceptions found.

### How to Use FloatGuard to capture floating-point exceptions

The following are instructions for setting up the AMD HIP code project of your own to use FloatGuard.

1. Replace the compiler in your code project with our wrapper script. For example, if your
code project uses the HIPCC macro in a Makefile to indicate compiler command, you should replace
it with this:

```
HIPCC = ${HOME}/FloatGuard/gdb_script/hipcc_wrapper.sh
```

2. If your code project has multiple source files, but you use a single compiler command
to compile and link the sources, please separate the compile and link commands into two.
For example:

```
${HIPCC} ${HIPFLAGS} -c main.cpp -o main.o
${HIPCC} ${HIPFLAGS} -c other.cpp -o other.o
${HIPCC} ${LINKFLAGS} main.o other.o -o main
```

3. Create a `setup.ini` file in the root directory of your code project. This file must contain
the following content:

```
[DEFAULT]
compile = make                  # the command line to compile the executable
run = ./div0                    # the command line to run the executable
clean = make clean_base         # the command line to clean the executable
```

4. Enter the root directory of your project, then call the `time_measure.py` script to run 
the FloatGuard tool.

```
[FloatGuard Directory]/gdb_script/time_measure.py
```

Log files containing details on the floating-point exceptions found are
outputted as `[code project directory name]_output.txt` file in the FloatGuard code repo directory.
Also `result.csv` updates the running time statistics and the number of
exceptions found.

5. Run `time_measure.py` again but with a cleanup parameter `-c` to call the clean up command line 
set in `setup.ini`, and clean up temporary files generated by FloatGuard.

```
[FloatGuard Directory]/gdb_script/time_measure.py -c
```
